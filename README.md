# SFIN
Code and data of CVPR 2025 paper "Noise Calibration and Spatial-Frequency Interactive Network for STEM Image Enhancement"

# How to Use
1. Down checkpoints [here](https://pan.baidu.com/s/1mOMZGUwRHxZpbYvrtYb30g?pwd=dgf5).
2. Unzip test dataset `haadf_data_test` and `bf_data_test.zip`.
3. Run `ours_gpu_demo.py` to get enhancement/detection results.
4. Run `metrics.py` to get PSNR/SSIM metrics.
